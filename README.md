# Warmth Bridge

### Purpose:

**Warmth Bridge** is a platform dedicated to facilitating donations of unused clothing.
Donors can contribute garments they no longer need and choose specific campaigns or projects to support,
as well as the locations for their contributions. Warmth Bridge coordinates with donors to collect
the clothing and ensures its distribution to rural areas, reaching individuals and communities
in genuine need.
